# Produce this file with:
#
#     /fset d         # Displays changed configuration options
#     w:/tmp/changed  # Saves shown options to /tmp/changed
#
# But I've done a lot of edits to that output here, so maybe you want
# to do that and then compare what has changed:
#
#     colordiff -u <(grep ^/ ~/.weechat/my.conf) <(grep ^/ /tmp/changed) | less
#
# Probably import this file by starting WeeChat, making sure the FIFO
# plugin is on (which is the default AFAIK):
#
#     sed -e '/^\//!d' -e 's/^/*/' my.conf > ~/.weechat/weechat_fifo
#
#
# !!! FOR THE notification_center PLUG-IN !!!
#
# My version of notification_center.py is modified from upstream to
# read its dependencies from ~/.weechat/python/packages.  You will
# need to do something like this to install those dependencies:
#
#     install -d $HOME/.weechat/python/packages
#     pip3 -t $HOME/.weechat/python/packages python-dateutil pync
