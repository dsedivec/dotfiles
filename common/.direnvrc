# Usage: layout uv
#
# Enables the uv project layout in the current directory, and syncs
# the dependencies in the project.
#
# This relies on the `uv` command being available in the PATH, and performs a
# sync on cd because uv is fast enough it's not impactful. It relies on uv's
# configuration file and environment variables, rather than arguments.
